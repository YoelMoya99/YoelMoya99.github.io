  Hi, I’m Yoel. I study Electrical Engineering and Math at UCR. This is a log of projects—personal or from work—that I can share publicly. The goal is to document what I can do, how I think, and what I’ve built. If you find something useful, feel free to use it (MIT License applies)..

## How does it work?

I make a post of a project, and that project has categories and tags. The categories show the area of engineering that will encompass the project (i.e. hardware, software, control, embedded, etc.), and the tags make kindof a list of the tools needed for the development and implementation of the project. 

In the `CATEGORIES` section, you will be able to parse the projects by categorie. In the `TAGS` section you will be able to do it by the tag/tool used. That way you can get the information that you want as fast as you can.

The `ARCHIVES` section presents a timeline of the projects (not when I made them, but when I documented them), so do with that information what you will. 

My contact info is in the `ABOUT` section, and I put my email there. If I get too much spam, I will hide it.

PD. Dark mode is in the bottom left...
