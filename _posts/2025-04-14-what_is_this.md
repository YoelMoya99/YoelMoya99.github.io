title: Overview of This Portfolio!
description: >-
  Hi, I’m Yoel. I study Electrical Engineering and Math at UCR. This is a log of projects—personal or from work—that I can share publicly. The goal is to document what I can do, how I think, and what I’ve built. If you find something useful, feel free to use it (MIT License applies).

## How does this work?

There are three main sections on the side bar:
- **The `CATEGORIES` section**:
    - I categorize the projects in *software*, *hardware*, *control*, things of that nature. In this section you can see how many projects belong to each category, that way you scroll through only the topics that you are interested in seeing. This is my preferred way of using this site.
- **The `TAGS` section**:
    - The same goes for tags, I will list all the tools that I've used for that project, so if you are interested finding out where I've used *MATLAB* or *Python* (or anything really); you can scroll through the projects that contain those tags only.
- **The `ARCHIVES` section**:
    - In case you are interested in seeing the timeline of all the projects in general, you can go to this section. Just keep in mind that the documentation of projects can lag behind their development, so the dates may not give an accurate development timeline, only the documentation timeline.
- **The `ABOUT` section**:
    - I put my contact information there, so there's that.

In the `HOME` section you can see the projects as they are posted, in case you want to scroll through everything. 

Also note that *Dark mode* is in the bottom left, so you can toggle that button to your preferred setting.
