title: What is this portfolio?
description: >-
  Hi, I’m Yoel. I study Electrical Engineering and Math at UCR. This is a log of projects—personal or from work—that I can share publicly. The goal is to document what I can do, how I think, and what I’ve built. If you find something useful, feel free to use it (MIT License applies)..
